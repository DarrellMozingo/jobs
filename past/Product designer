## Snyk Product Designer
**Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.** We're looking for a full time Product Designer who can work closely with our excellent team and even better users to translate this vision into an intuitive, effective product developers love to use.

## About [Snyk](https://snyk.io)

<img src="https://snyk.io/images/snyk-dog.png" width="100" alt="Snyk logo" />

Open Source code, pulled from npm, Maven, RubyGems and others, is often the majority of code in an application, and yet it receives no security attention. Most developers do nothing to track known vulnerabilities in the packages they use, and trust this code as though its their own. This risk is massive today, and is only made worse by growing use of packages and the simplicity offered by package managers. It is further compounded by the fact that unpatched servers, which account for most successful exploits today, are slowly being abstracted away by PaaS and Serverless, making vulnerabilities in open source code packages become the easiest way in. 

**At Snyk we believe this problem can only be fixed by developers and DevOps teams, and built into the way we create software.** 
We offer a SaaS CI/CD and runtime monitoring product that helps organisations continuously find & fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down.

**Snyk is a dev tooling company at heart.**
We care about securing the open source world itself as much as as we care about our enterprise grade solution that lets large companies consume open source code while controlling risk. We operate at scale, with many thousands of users across both open source and enterprise. Snyk's client software has been downloaded over 700,000 times, and we continuously protect over 10,000 open source repositories. We receive regular community contributions (and love!), have [great partners](https://snyk.io/partners) expanding our reach, and have more than 600 badges in GitHub championing us, including top projects like [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/) and [request](https://github.com/request/request/). 

**Lastly, Snyk is a growth oriented venture backed company.** We raised a $3M seed round from US investors in October '15, and received another large infusion from our investors recently, demonstrating their excitement about our progress and potential. 
Our team numbers 17 amazing people in two large offices in Tel Aviv & London, and a smaller presence in the US. We take a lot of care to keep a warm and inclusive environment, and make sure our distributed team gets plenty of face time over video and in trips.
