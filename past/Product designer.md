## Snyk Product Designer
**Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.** We're looking for a full time Product Designer who can work closely with our excellent team and even better users to translate this vision into an intuitive, effective product developers love to use.

## About [Snyk](https://snyk.io)

<img src="https://snyk.io/images/snyk-dog.png" width="100" alt="Snyk logo" />

Open Source code, pulled from npm, Maven, RubyGems and others, is often the majority of code in an application, and yet it receives no security attention. Most developers do nothing to track known vulnerabilities in the packages they use, and trust this code as though its their own. This risk is massive today, and is only made worse by growing use of packages and the simplicity offered by package managers. It is further compounded by the fact that unpatched servers, which account for most successful exploits today, are slowly being abstracted away by PaaS and Serverless, making vulnerabilities in open source code packages become the easiest way in. 

**At Snyk we believe this problem can only be fixed by developers and DevOps teams, and built into the way we create software.** 
We offer a SaaS CI/CD and runtime monitoring product that helps organisations continuously find & fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down.

**Snyk is a dev tooling company at heart.**
We care about securing the open source world itself as much as as we care about our enterprise grade solution that lets large companies consume open source code while controlling risk. We operate at scale, with many thousands of users across both open source and enterprise. Snyk's client software has been downloaded over 700,000 times, and we continuously protect over 10,000 open source repositories. We receive regular community contributions (and love!), have [great partners](https://snyk.io/partners) expanding our reach, and have more than 600 badges in GitHub championing us, including top projects like [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/) and [request](https://github.com/request/request/). 

**Lastly, Snyk is a growth oriented venture backed company.** We raised a $3M seed round from US investors in October '15, and received another large infusion from our investors recently, demonstrating their excitement about our progress and potential. 
Our team numbers 17 amazing people in two large offices in Tel Aviv & London, and a smaller presence in the US. We take a lot of care to keep a warm and inclusive environment, and make sure our distributed team gets plenty of face time over video and in trips.

## Product Designer - London or Tel Aviv

We are looking for a senior product designer, based in one of our main offices in London or Tel Aviv. 

In this role, you will own all design aspects of the Snyk product from creating UX mockups and customer user testing to 
implementing and maintaining our design components, working closely with product and dev.
You will also work closely with customers, sales and marketing, making sure the design answers the customers real needs and is aligned with Snyks overall positionning and design language.
You will be reporting directly to the vp of product management.

### Responsibilities
**Oversee the UX and visual design of Snyk**
Snyk isn’t just a CLI tool – it includes our web app, marketing pages, email campaigns, new vulnerability alerts, and our integrations with other products. We’re looking for someone who can craft a seamless user flow – such as from getting a vulnerability alert in Slack, to reading a test report, to opening a Fix PR.

**Organise and run user testing sessions**
We like to test new features with real users and make improvements before releasing them. You’ll be in charge of making this happen.

**Maintain our living design system**
You’ll be working closely with our Front-end Developer to help build upon and maintain our Fractal-based living design system, which is used by the whole engineering team.

**Improve our design process**
We want to improve how we progress from the design discovery phase to shipping a new feature. We will look to you for guidance on how we can progress smoothly between different design and build phases.

**Knowledge sharing**
We don’t like silos of knowledge (leaving us flailing when someone goes on holiday), so we encourage knowledge sharing – from writing great documentation for our team to demoing how to do something. One of your responsibilities will be to help us collectively improve our design skills – not so that we can become designers, but so that we can keep things moving when you take time off.

### Skills & experience

#### Required
- 3+ years of designing web products.
- Comfortable writing HTML and CSS to maintain and create new components in our living design system.
- Experience working on a B2B product aimed at technical users.
- Experience with maintaining a design system.
- Experience with leading tools such as Sketch and Axure.
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English
- Willingness to travel quarterly between our Tel Aviv and London offices 

#### Nice-to-have
- An understanding of Git (or using GitHub which we use extensively)
- JavaScript knowledge
- Experience with using Handlebars or similar for templating (our design system uses Handlebars)
- Familiarity with using the CLI
- An understanding of how package managers and versioning works
- Fondness of animals, especially dogs! (you will be looking at our dog logo a lot)
