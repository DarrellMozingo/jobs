Using open source code is a major productivity boost, but it's also a significant security risk. Most developers consume this code off the internet blindly, doing nothing to track known vulnerabilities or scrutinise the authors of the packages they use. The tools available to the few who do act are hard to use, do little to help fix the issues they report, and are not sufficiently deep security-wise.

This risk is massive today, made worse by growing open source use and trends such as PaaS and Serverless. Gartner estimates the use of tools to help tackle this problem will grow from 10% of DevOps initiatives in 2016 to 70% in 2019, and others like RedMonk and Forrester predict massive growth as well.

**At Snyk we believe this problem can only be fixed by developers and DevOps teams, building it into the way we create software.** We offer a SaaS CI/CD and runtime monitoring product that helps organisations continuously find & fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down development. Our tools integrate into dev & DevOps workflows seamlessly, and go beyond reporting a problem to offering single click fixes.

**This is both a business problem and a community concern.**
We care about securing the open source world itself as much as as we care about our enterprise grade solution that lets large companies consume open source code while controlling risk. We operate at scale, supporting tens of thousands of users running hundreds of thousands of tests each month. We receive regular community contributions (and love!), have [great partners](https://snyk.io/partners) expanding our reach, and have over a thousand badges in GitHub championing us, including top projects like [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/) and [request](https://github.com/request/request/).

**Lastly, Snyk is a growth oriented venture backed company.** We closed a $3M seed round from US investors in early '16, and received another large infusion from our investors more recently, demonstrating their excitement about our progress and potential. Our team numbers around 20 amazing people in two large offices in Tel Aviv & London, and a distributed presence in the US. We take a lot of care to keep a warm and inclusive environment, and make sure our distributed team gets plenty of face time over video and in trips.
