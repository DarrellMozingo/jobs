Snyk is on a mission to secure the way people develop and consume open source. We analyse and protect your projects, eliminating known vulnerabilities and securing applications in runtime.

Developers care a lot about security, but currently have too few options to actually do something about it. We make security an aspect of quality, built into the software from the beginning.

We run a distributed team between our London and Tel Aviv offices. Looking forward to keep growing and doing great stuff together! 

To have a blast with us, it helps if:
* You like to both start new things and get them done
* You care about the impact you have on the end user
* You want to advance the way people develop software (did I say 'open source' yet?)
* You wish to share the way you write code and not just the end result
* You appreciate learning and helping others learn

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
